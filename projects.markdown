# [Bird City Brunswick](https://birdcitybrunswick.org/)
I'm currently working with a small group of people interested in getting Brunswick certified as an official "Bird City". Our plan is to use WordPress to help with communication/visibility, but I think we will have a strong mapping need in the future.

# [GISCorps](https://www.giscorps.org/)
I'll be a member of the GISCorps Core Committee (CC) for the next 2 (ish) years. So far I've only helped launch a couple projects and fixed an ArcGIS Dashboard. The organization has been around for over 20 years and the work they do is excellent. My goal is to refine the FOSS4G software requirements that would emerge from a group like Bird City Brunswick and then determine what kind of technologies we would need to have experience with on the CC to better support engagements that do not use Esri products.
