    <h1>Jeffrey Scarmazzi</h1>
    <p>After spending 5 years in the Marine Corps as a videographer, I made a transition into IT and found GIS. By day I am a full stack GIS developer for Esri Professional Services. At night, I volunteer my time as a Core Committee Member of GISCorps and try to think about how GIS technology can be used to make my community a better place.</p>
