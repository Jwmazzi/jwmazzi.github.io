# Jeff Scarmazzi - GIS Developer
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Image Description" style="width: 200px;"/>

After spending 5 years in the Marine Corps as a videographer, I made a transition into IT and found GIS. By day I am a full stack GIS developer for Esri Professional Services. At night, I volunteer my time as a Core Committee Member of GISCorps and try to think about how GIS technology can be used to make my community a better place.
