# Online Chore Tracker
Bird City needed a way to [keep track of garden chores](https://birdcitybrunswick.org/community-garden/). For now, we just keep track of what was done, but having the ability to schedule/assign work would be very nice. Building a public form with ArcGIS Survey123, using a personal license for ArcGIS Online, has worked out so far. However, I am using my personal license to AGOL which means everything has to be public. Not being able to chore submissions to specific people is a bummer, but I think what we have will be a solid baseline. Once all of our requirements actually take shape, either collecting funds for a non-profit AGOL subscription or just building something from scratch are the likely next steps.

# Getting Bed Names
I named the four beds A, B, C, and D. These will have to do for now because I suspect coming up with better names will take time. A few others thought a fundraiser might work and we can replicate our Bird Vote from last year at the upcoming [Springfest](https://brunswickmd.gov/index.asp?SEC=091B68D6-FCD8-4B6E-A991-AFEFC0667011&DE=1648ACEA-1AFC-4025-B2FA-13A2F6573377&Type=B_BASIC).
