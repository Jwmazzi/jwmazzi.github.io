            <h1>Online Chore Tracker</h1>
<p>Building a public form with ArcGIS Survey123, using a personal license for ArcGIS Online, has worked out so far. However, not being able to track people is a bummer because I don't plan to have anyone type their name into a text field.</p>

<h2>Getting Bed Names</h2>
<p>Right now, I named the beds A, B, C, and D. With an image better than the one below and/or some training, I think we can get people oriented. Maybe giving people the chance to name the plots if they do something for the community would be good.</p>
