<p>Bird City needed a way to <a href="https://birdcitybrunswick.org/community-garden/">keep track of garden chores</a>. For now, we just keep track of what was done, but having the ability to schedule/assign work would be very nice. Building a public form with ArcGIS Survey123, using a personal license for ArcGIS Online, has worked out so far. However, I am using my personal license to AGOL which means everything has to be public. Not being able to connect chore submissions to specific people is a bummer, but I think what we have a solid baseline. Once our requirements actually take shape, either collecting funds for a non-profit AGOL subscription or just building something from scratch are the likely next steps.</p>

<h1>Getting Bed Names</h1>
<p>We have four beds this year instead of two. I named the four beds A, B, C, and D. These will have to do for now because I suspect coming up with better names will take time. A few others thought a fundraiser might work and we can replicate our Bird Vote from last year at the upcoming <a href="https://brunswickmd.gov/index.asp?SEC=091B68D6-FCD8-4B6E-A991-AFEFC0667011&amp;DE=1648ACEA-1AFC-4025-B2FA-13A2F6573377&amp;Type=B_BASIC">Springfest</a>.</p>
