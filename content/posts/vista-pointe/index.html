            <h1>Vista Pointe Annexation</h1>
<p>Roughly 60 acres of forest will be incorporated into Brusnwick and converted into a senior living development. Envision Brunswick, a local activist group, wanted to collect 1600 signatures to force a referendum vote on the Vista Pointe development. We didn't collect the signatures by the deadline, but our canvassing effort covered most of the city and likely generated an awareness around the topic that we can leverage moving forward.</p>

<p>Removing this forest will impact existing habitats, send stormwater runoff into Knoxville communities, and degrade the water quality in Brunswick.</p>

<h1>Brunswick Canopy</h1>
<p>Last year, Bird City took imagery from the <a href="https://gis-fcgmd.opendata.arcgis.com/pages/download-data">Frederick County GIS Portal</a>, ran it through an off-the-shelf classification tool, and extracted everything defined as tree canopy. If you compare that canopy to the municipal boundary, the amount of city covered by trees is roughly 30%. Annexing Vista Pointe will push this number lower and we need to ensure there is a boundary the city will not cross in the future.</p>
