            <h1>Vista Pointe Annexation</h1>
<p>Roughly 60 acres of forest will be incorporated into Brusnwick and converted into a senior living development. Envision Brunswick, a local activist collective, wanted to collect 1600 signatures to force a referendum vote on the Vista Pointe development. We didn't collect the signatures by the deadline, but our canvassing effort covered most of the city and likely generated an awareness around the topic that we can leverage moving forward.</p>

<p>Removing this forest will remove wild habitats and send additional runoff into the Potomac.</p>

<p>There is a community impacted by the potential stormwater runoff in Knoxville, in addition to the loss of existing tree canopy.</p>
<h1>Brunswick Canopy</h1>
<p>Last year, Bird City took imagery available on the Frederick County GIS Portal, ran it through an off-the-shelf classification tool, and extracted everything defined as tree canopy. You can do an overlay on the municipal boundary to get a percentage of the city under our tree canopy. It came out to something like 30%. Initial reviews of the output looked good, but it was leaf off and a few years old.</p>
