# Why even start a blog?
I need to get serious about being intentional. This blog will be a way for me to measure progress on a number of projects that I think are important. Hopefully it will become a way to connect with other people and eventually be a technical time capsule for my kids.
* Technology
    * GISCorps - Official involvement in the GIS community outside of work.
    * Brunswick - There are 3 local groups attempting to organize "green" initiatives. The Brunswick Green Team (BGT) holds meetings at the library and I'm not sure what they are doing yet. There is another group focused on becoming a Maryland "bird city" and they have a set of goals/criteria defined by the state. 
* Personal Enrichment
    * Drawing
        * My own doodles are certainly one part, but I think documenting how Eliza is approaching drawing would be cool. 
    * Photos
        * We should be taking more pictures of natural beauty in this area. I do hate social media in almost every form, but the reality is that we have to meet people here and raise awareness for local issues (e.g., data center development).
