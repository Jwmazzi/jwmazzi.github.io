# WordPress for Bird City Brunswick
Learning WordPress and getting a baseline out the door for Bird City Brunswick is taking more time than I expected. However, Megan and I finally got something decent enough to show to Sarah. I sent an email to Eric Stuyck, a local photographer, and asked him for permission to use a couple photos for the landing page. No response after a couple days, but maybe I will bump into him again down by the towpath?

At this point, I've met with Sarah and Calvin to discuss our initial ideas for the website. We still need a domain name and will be using <a href="https://lilmappy.com" target="_blank">LilMappy</a> until we have another solution. Both Sarah and Calvin had good ideas for how we can create some conceptual hierarchy around various Categories or Tags to organize content. 

<div class="photo-block">
    <h4>Bird City Brunswick Baseline</h4>
    <img style="border: 1px solid black" class="me" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets\images\pressed\BaselineDesktop.jpg" alt="Joanna 404"/>
    <p>We landed on the default Twenty Twenty-Three Theme and it seems like a good place to start</p>
    <img style="border: 1px solid black; width: 50%" class="me" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets\images\pressed\BaselineMobile.jpg" alt="Joanna 404"/>
    <p>There is a lot of work to do, but the default mobile presentation is enough to get started.</p>
