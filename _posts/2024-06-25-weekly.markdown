# WordPress for Brunswick
Learning WordPress and getting a basline out the door for Bird City Brunswick is taking more time than I expected. However, Megan and I finally got something decent enough to show to Sarah together.
<div class="photo-block">
    <h4>Bird City</h4>
    <img class="me" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets\images\pressed\BaselineDesktop.jpg" alt="Joanna 404"/>
    <p>TODO - Let's say something about this one.</p>
</div>

# Not a Designer
In addition to getting WordPress under my belt, I need to pick up something like Canva to get flyers and other media out the door for events.
