# [Bird City Brunswick](https://birdcitybrunswick.org)
We have a baseline for the [website](https://birdcitybrunswick.org) and Sarah has really jumped in with both feet. Our design/layout is about as basic as you can get, but this is fine if our primary goal is information dissemination. Getting people (other than Sarah) writing posts and creating events is the immediate focus. Next will be making the posts searchable over time and ensuring that our calendar is working as expected. I also need to schedule a regular meeting at the library to develop governance SOPs around the website.

    <p>The Events Calendar plugin seems great so far. I've noticed some potentially annoying timezone issues with the Google Calendar integration when you sign up for the full calendar, but Sarah/Calvin haven't complained yet.</p>

# GISCorps
It's possible I'll stop focusing on GISCorps in this space. The organization is doing amazing work and I'm glad to be helping. However, I don't think the needs of GISCorps align much with my personal technology interests; e.g., learning more about how FOSS4G can deliver better communication tools to local communities. However, continuing with GISCorps as a way to promote good time management is still valuable. This week I am launching a mission for [Warehouse4Good](https://warehouses4good.org) and this will be my first "solo" project on the Core Committee.

Deprioritizing GISCorps means that I need to organize my time such that I can support the Bird City website and also work on a FOSS4G PWA. Next week I should at the very least provide a wireframe for an application that can meaningfullly be used to create a "sketch" that would ultimately be shareable with others. Sticking with modified GeoJSON files that can be stored as a collection of flat files, discovered, and then downloaded/uploaded is the initial goal I think. At the moment, I've been digitizing events in into a Geopackage with QGIS and I think I should keep this part of my cycling routine to monitor trash along the [C&O Canal](https://www.canaltrust.org/plan/explorer-mobile-app/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-ai0BhDPARIsAB6hmP5JcWMKXo7OZgvQuqDQmo03zPlmcOPIS1T1n7SWSQdyR5EWFCDXrxQaAsyKEALw_wcB).

# Journaling
Jason's journaling has me motivated to be more intentional with my own doodling. For now, I've landed on having my journal split into two sections: the left side for notes and the right for meditative doodles. The trick now is actually waking up at 7 AM (or earlier?) each morning to get some time for writing. It would also be good to block out 15 minutes in the evening to summarize any research/development I do after the kids are asleep. 

I've also gone through my previous posts and blurred any sensitive notes on uploaded journal pages. Going forward I will just pay more attention, but deciding where to draw the line with redacting my journal will be interesting. For example, I'll keep records of my Arkham Horror campaign, but redact anything about todo items at work.

    <p>Both of the girls are taking our books and making some quick sketches, but they also produce a lot of quality stuff I just can't keep up with. Joanna is gettingh much better and I'll be sure to add some of her stuff next week.</p>

    <p>Eliza drew this deity while eating lunch. Next week it would be cool to dig up all of the other deities she has drawn in this style and review how they are similar/different.</p>
