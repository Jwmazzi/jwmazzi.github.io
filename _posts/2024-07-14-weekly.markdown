# [Bird City Brunswick](https://birdcitybrunswick.org)

Met at the library today to discuss the website and get an [event](https://birdcitybrunswick.org/event/native-garden-tour/) published on [Eventbrite]((https://www.eventbrite.com/e/brunswick-natives-and-flowers-garden-tour-tickets-937836924487)). We agreed that having governance around our various tools (e.g., Facebook, Eventbrite, WordPress) makes sense. I've started setting up a document to track requests and oustanding issues for the website in Google Drive. The plan is to use Bitwarden to handle shared credentials and a training event might be a good idea in the future.

    <p>Using the templates from Google Sheets for tracking various R&D tasks seems reasonable.</p>

Aside from the technical stuff, I got a chance to take Megan's new camera out to the community garden to get photos/videos for the website. It's a great place to "get away" and the work BCB has put into the garden so far is really incredible. A few people at BCB think that creating a short video each month for the website would be a good investment of time. I'm thinking that a 1-2 minute documentary we can add to the [volunteer page](https://birdcitybrunswick.org/volunteer/) of the website is a good start.

    <p>Pulling weeds put me into that "Zen" place that is absolutely essential for sanity these days. </p>

Eliza worked on a few pages for a story this weekend. Apparently she has an ongoing story and the rest of us just get a sneak peek now and then. This one was about a group of investigators who have jewelry that keeps them alerted to trouble in New York City.

    <p>This is the first page and has the names of all the characters. We need to add the lettering this week.</p>

    <p>I'm crazy proud of how Eliza organized this page showing how each character activates their jewelry.</p>
