# Journaling IRL
Jason, chatting over ice cream with the girls, said he is planning 3 separate journals. I've been doing doodles a bit more often, but not picking a dedicated time of the day like Jason is going to hold me back. We did have to shift out a book this week because Eliza got ahold of my journal the other day.

Below are some images from the latest insert that cycled out of my journal.

<div class="photo-block">
    <h4>Joanna Not Found</h4>
    <img class="me" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets\images\journal\20240609_Joanna.jpg" alt="Joanna 404"/>
    <p>On Easter we went to church with Megan's parents. The nursery had a program to track children, but didn't know that certain numbers just shouldn't be used in the context of child tracking</p>
</div>

<div class="photo-block">
    <h4>Doodle Review</h4>
    <img class="me" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets\images\journal\20240609_TwoPageB.jpg" alt="Example A"/>
    <p>These 2 examples are what I think I've really landed on when it comes to my doodle. Lot's of big curve used to block space so that I fill it with smaller noise. I may have taken a pen or a darker pencil to a couple spots on each of these.</p>
    <img class="me"      src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets\images\journal\20240609_TwoPageA.jpg" alt="Example B"/>
    <img class="me"      src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets\images\journal\20240609_DrawingA.jpg" alt="Example C"/>
    <p>These kinds of drawings are somewhat new for me. Maybe I don't always have to fill the page. Finding a bare minimum in my doogle vocabulary might be a useful drawing project.</p>
</div>

<div class="photo-block">
    <h4>Other Artifacts</h4>
    <img class="me" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets\images\journal\20240609_DrawingC.jpg" alt="Megan"/>
    <p>Megan hopped into this journal and drew me. Moving forwrd, there will be <b>a lot</b> more Eliza creeping into these pages</p>
    <img class="me"      src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets\images\journal\20240609_DrawingD.jpg" alt="Garden A"/>
    <img class="me"      src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets\images\journal\20240609_DrawingF.jpg" alt="Garden B"/>
    <p>The tech idea in my mind for most of this journal was a mobile application to manage our gardening tasks. This general theme has been hijacked by the need to create an app for local sustainability initiatives.</p>

# Techno Blog
My weekly goal from a technology perspective should either be focused on learning either WordPress or FOSS GIS to support sustainable teams here in Brunswick. Maybe have 2 goals on the technology front each week and just accept that certain things, like finishing Micah's book, will just have to get a new priority.

This week was definitely all about learning WordPress. It was also about getting a project started for GISCorps, but I'll start covering that stuff in a separate category. I've landed on using Astra and starting with a very, very simple layout that works on mobile. 

<div class="photo-block">
    <h4>Bird City Baseline</h4>
    <img class="me" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets\images\journal\WP_Baseline.jpg" alt="WordPress"/>
    <p>Definitely going to need to add a few colors (e.g., a couple greens and a brown) and figure out the About & Contact pages. Maybe those can be collapsed into a single page?</p>
